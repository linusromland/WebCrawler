# WebCrawler

Easy web crawler that's **indexing the web**. WebCrawler is written in ASP.NET and will in the future save all the links to a MongoDB Database. 


# Usage

The **WebCrawler** is very easy to use. 

You need to have dotnet installed on your system.
<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/">DotNet</a>

You download the project by git clone or downloading the zip. 
Then you go to the webcrawler folder and run:

> dotnet run 

# Goal

My goal of this project is to create a better crawler then my <a href="https://github.com/linusromland/WebCrawlerJS">NodeJS version</a>. <br>
My starting point is <a href="https://github.com/superfroggman">@superfroggman</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/superfroggman/WebCrawler">Webcrawler</a> since it was a good base.<br>
What i will add to this project (i hope) is multhreading for much better performance, and "hits" taken from the hits system i had in <a href="https://github.com/linusromland/WebCrawlerJS">WebCrawlerJS</a>. This will add a ranking system for sites.
